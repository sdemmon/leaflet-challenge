# leaflet-challenge

This project aims to visualize earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), facilitating better understanding of seismic activity worldwide. The USGS, responsible for providing scientific data on natural hazards and environmental impacts, lacks effective visualization tools for their vast earthquake datasets. This challenge tasks developers with creating a solution to visualize earthquake data, enhancing public and government awareness of planetary issues. The project involves two parts:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization: Utilize Leaflet and JavaScript to import earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, plotting earthquakes on a map based on their geographic coordinates. Customized data markers reflect earthquake magnitude and depth, with popups providing additional information. A legend offers context for the map data.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional): An optional challenge involves plotting a second dataset illustrating the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. This part enhances skills by adding more data layers, base maps, and layer controls to the visualization.
